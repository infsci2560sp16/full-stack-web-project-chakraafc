<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Ideal Homecare Agency LLC is a privately owned company by a team of experienced nurses<br>
who are committed in providing excellent homecare services. Our main goal is to prevent<br>
 clients from going into acute care facilities and foster their happiness by being around <br>
 family and providing care at well-known comfortable social environment. We truly understand<br>
 what it means to be around family for an elderly and sick population. Since we have experience<br>
 working with vulnerable elderly and sick population we want to provide optimum services from our <br>
 caring hands and loving hearts. We want to make difference in many peopleâ€™s life, as we are<br>
 professional caring nurses.<br><br><br>
 
 Ideal Homecare Agency LLC was established in the year 2014 initiated by a group of young hard <br>
 working new American nurses. Our team members settled in The United State around 2008 and started <br>
 the dream of becoming compassionate nurses. Apparently it was not easy for our members to turn the<br>
 dream a reality in this foreign land. With constant hard work and dedication for years, we were able<br>
 to graduate as fresh nurses. During our working experience, we felt the extreme necessity of care <br>
 which is culturally appropriated to our clients, particularly for new Americans. Eventually, the idea<br>
 of establishing Ideal Homecare Agency LLC was developed as a platform to serve those needy populations.<br>
 Since nurses are always at front line while providing care, we as nurses firmly believe that we will<br>
 serve our clients in the best way possible because we know how to care.  Also, we have learned difficulties,<br> 
 hardships and the best way to help each other as we have had experience of refugee lives for two decades. <br>
 With constant hard work and continue education we are proud to have dedicated nurses in our agency standing<br>
 together hand in hand to serve the community in a very unique and well- managed way. We can bring all <br>
 our experiences into Ideal Homecare Agency to make this as a valuable asset to our needy population. <br>
 We together want to leave no stone unturned to make our services in favor of our growing needy population.<br>
 Your family is like our own and we stand by their side day in and day out making them feel happy and <br>
 proud for who they are.<p>
