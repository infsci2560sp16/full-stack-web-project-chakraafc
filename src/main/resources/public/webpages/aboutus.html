<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Ideal Homecare Agency LLC is a privately owned company by a team of experienced nurses
who are committed in providing excellent homecare services. Our main goal is to prevent
 clients from going into acute care facilities and foster their happiness by being around
 family and providing care at well-known comfortable social environment. We truly understand
 what it means to be around family for an elderly and sick population. Since we have experience
 working with vulnerable elderly and sick population we want to provide optimum services from our
 caring hands and loving hearts. We want to make difference in many peopleâ€™s life, as we are
 professional caring nurses.<br>

 Ideal Homecare Agency LLC was established in the year 2014 initiated by a group of young hard
 working new American nurses. Our team members settled in The United State around 2008 and started
 the dream of becoming compassionate nurses. Apparently it was not easy for our members to turn the
 dream a reality in this foreign land. With constant hard work and dedication for years, we were able
 to graduate as fresh nurses. During our working experience, we felt the extreme necessity of care
 which is culturally appropriated to our clients, particularly for new Americans. Eventually, the idea
 of establishing Ideal Homecare Agency LLC was developed as a platform to serve those needy populations.
 Since nurses are always at front line while providing care, we as nurses firmly believe that we will
 serve our clients in the best way possible because we know how to care.  Also, we have learned difficulties,
 hardships and the best way to help each other as we have had experience of refugee lives for two decades.
 With constant hard work and continue education we are proud to have dedicated nurses in our agency standing
 together hand in hand to serve the community in a very unique and well- managed way. We can bring all
 our experiences into Ideal Homecare Agency to make this as a valuable asset to our needy population.
 We together want to leave no stone unturned to make our services in favor of our growing needy population.
 Your family is like our own and we stand by their side day in and day out making them feel happy and
 proud for who they are.<p>
